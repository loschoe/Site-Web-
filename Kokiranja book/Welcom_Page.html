            <h2>Chapter 1 : Beneath the Mask</h2>
            <p class="text">
                The city of Raventide stretched out like a living, breathing labyrinth beneath a cloud-streaked sky. Towering skyscrapers glinted in the pale morning light, their glass facades hiding the decay and corruption of the streets below. The air hummed faintly with the distant roar of traffic and the occasional siren, but here, high above the chaos, the sound was a dull murmur, as if the city's heartbeat had been muted by the altitude.
                <br><br>In the penthouse suite of one of Raventide's tallest towers, Razy stirred from her sleep. The room around her was opulent but cold, its dark marble floors and gilded furniture a constant reminder of the world she inhabited. The golden morning light seeped through the heavy curtains, reflecting off polished surfaces and casting soft shadows over the room. Razy stretched and sat up, her long, blonde hair falling in loose waves around her shoulders. Her golden eyes, still hazy with sleep, scanned the room, catching sight of her neatly folded high school uniform draped over a chair. At 170 cm tall, she had an elegant, willowy frame that made her appear older than her seventeen years. Her reflection in the floor-to-ceiling mirror near her bed caught her attention—a faint trace of weariness lingered in her gaze. With a sigh, she rose, slipping into her uniform—a classic blazer, pleated skirt, and tie. Though she wore it with the same casual ease as any other student, the uniform felt like armor, a way to blend into a life that was never truly hers.
                <br><br>As Razy stepped out of her room, the scent of fresh coffee and warm pastries wafted through the grand hallway. The penthouse was a maze of luxury, with high ceilings, ornate chandeliers, and walls lined with paintings that whispered of power and wealth. She walked briskly, her footsteps muffled by the plush carpet, until she turned a corner and nearly collided with Belphegor. The commander's presence was as striking as ever. At just under 175cm, he exuded a quiet, unsettling confidence. His short, yellow hair was slicked back, and his single yellow eye glimmered with sharp awareness, while the other remained hidden beneath a sleek black eyepatch. He leaned lightly on his cane, its harpoon-like end glinting in the light, a faint reminder of its true purpose. His yellow-and-black suit, tailored to perfection, gave him the appearance of a predator who preferred elegance over chaos. “Good morning, Miss Razy,” Belphegor greeted her with a slight nod, his tone polite but tinged with a subtle authority. “Morning,” Razy replied, offering him a small smile. The commanders, including Belphegor, had always treated her with care, but their unwavering protection felt like a gilded cage. “You're up early.” Belphegor gave a faint chuckle, tapping his cane lightly against the f loor. “Always. Your father is waiting for you in the dining room.” His yellow eye seemed to study her for a moment, and then he inclined his head. “Enjoy your breakfast, princess.” She sighed as he walked away, his presence fading into the shadows of the hallway. His footsteps were almost soundless, a ghostly reminder of the silent protection that followed her everywhere. She knew that, somewhere nearby, another commander or operative would be watching her, unseen but always present. The dining room was an expansive space dominated by a long, dark wood table polished to a mirror shine. A glittering chandelier hung above, its crystal facets scattering light across the room. At the head of the table sat Lucifer, her father, already sipping from a delicate porcelain cup. Lucifer cut an imposing figure despite his modest height of 165 cm. His short, golden-blond hair caught the morning light, and his striking red eyes, intense yet softened in her presence, carried an aura of command. Dressed in his customary white tailcoat with red trim, black gloves, and polished boots, he exuded a calculated elegance. His hat rested on a nearby stand, its golden snake coiling around it like a silent guardian. But as soon as Razy stepped into the room, all traces of formality melted away. Lucifer's face lit up, a genuine warmth softening his sharp features. “There's my little sunbeam,” he said, rising from his chair to greet her. “Good morning, Father,” Razy replied, smiling faintly as he kissed her forehead. His affection was an anchor in her tumultuous life, even if it came from a man who could make the entire city tremble with a word. He held her at arm's length, scanning her face with a doting expression. “You've been staying up too late again, haven't you?” he chided gently. “Those dark circles don't suit you.” “I'm fine,” she said, brushing off his concern. “You are not fine until I say you are,” Lucifer said with a small chuckle, guiding her to the seat beside him. “You work so hard to live among the ordinary, but I wish you wouldn't exhaust yourself so much. You don't need to prove anything to anyone.”
                <br><br>His words carried a weight that made her heart ache. She knew his love for her was boundless, but it also came with a fierce protectiveness that could feel suffocating at times. He gestured for a servant to bring her breakfast, watching closely as the plate of fresh fruit and pastries was set before her. “Eat,” he urged. “I won't have you neglecting yourself.” Razy took a bite of a croissant to appease him, her thoughts lingering on how fragile this father-daughter dynamic could be. Lucifer ruled Hell's Circle with an iron grip, but in these moments, he was simply her father—a man who saw her as the center of his universe. He sipped his coffee, his red eyes fixed on her with unguarded affection. “I had your favorite tea imported last week,” he said suddenly, as if remembering something important. “From that little village in the south. You liked it so much the last time.”“Thank you, Father,” Razy said softly, feeling the weight of his efforts. He would raze the world to make her smile, a truth that both comforted and terrified her. After breakfast, Lucifer stood, placing his gloved hand on her shoulder. His gaze softened even further, his red eyes brimming with tenderness. “I have matters to attend to,” he said, but his tone was reluctant, as though leaving her side was the last thing he wanted to do. “If anything troubles you, no matter how small, tell me. I'll handle it.” “Yes, Father,” she replied, her voice steady, but her chest tightened under the intensity of his love. He lingered for a moment, his hand brushing her cheek before he turned to leave.
                <br><br>As the door closed behind him, Razy lingered in the dining room for a moment, staring into her cup of tea as the steam spiraled upward, vanishing into the air. The warmth of her father's words still clung to her like a comforting shawl, but beneath it, an unease simmered. Her father loved her, she knew that without question. Yet his love was intertwined with the organization that controlled this city—the same organization that turned lives into collateral damage. Somewhere out there, Leant's family still bore the scars of Hell's Circle, and that bitter truth was one she could never share with anyone, least of all him. The clatter of the servants clearing the table snapped her out of her thoughts. She stood abruptly, smoothing her skirt as she moved toward the door. If she lingered too long in this house, the walls would start to feel like a prison. The elevator ride down to the main lobby was silent, save for the faint hum of machinery. The polished mirrors lining the elevator reflected her neatly composed appearance, but Razy couldn't shake the sense that they also showed the weight of her carefully hidden burdens. When the doors slid open, she stepped out into the grand entrance hall. It was a place designed to intimidate, with its towering marble columns and elaborate mosaics depicting mythological scenes on the floor. She had walked through this space countless times, yet it never failed to remind her of the power her family wielded. As she made her way toward the building's exit, a familiar voice called out. “Miss Razy, leaving without a word?” She turned to see Belphegor, standing at the edge of the room with his usual air of calm confidence. His cane clicked softly against the floor as he approached, his yellow eye fixed on her with quiet amusement. “I thought I'd go to school like an ordinary person,” she replied lightly, though she knew that any attempt at normalcy was an illusion. Belphegor smiled faintly, tilting his head as he studied her. “Ordinary is a funny word for someone like you,” he said. “Still, it's commendable that you try. Shall I escort you to the car?” “That's not necessary,” she said quickly, already dreading the idea of him shadowing her. “I can manage.” He paused for a moment, his expression unreadable, then gave a small nod. “Very well. But be careful out there.” Razy offered him a faint smile, knowing he wasn't truly letting her go. Somewhere nearby, someone—perhaps Belphegor himself—would be watching, ensuring her safety. It was a comfort she hadn't asked for but couldn't escape. The car ride to school passed uneventfully, the cityscape rushing by in a blur of glass and steel. Raventide had two faces: one of prosperity, where the wealthy enjoyed their luxuries in peace, and another of despair, where crime and fear reigned. The farther the car traveled, the more the disparity became evident, though Razy knew the invisible thread of her family's influence connected every part of this sprawling metropolis.
                <br><br>When the car pulled up to Raventide High, Razy stepped out, smoothing her skirt once more as she glanced up at the familiar facade. The building was old but well-maintained, with ivy creeping along its brick walls. Students milled about in small groups, their chatter blending into a low hum. Razy adjusted her bag on her shoulder and stepped through the gates, her golden eyes scanning the crowd. And then, as if by fate, she saw him. Leant Vale stood near the edge of the courtyard, leaning casually against a lamppost. At 180 cm, he had a sturdy, muscular frame that hinted at the countless hours he spent training, a testament to his determination to follow in his father's footsteps. His short brown hair caught the sunlight, and his warm brown eyes held a depth that Razy had always found captivating. He looked up, catching her gaze. A smile spread across his face, boyish and genuine, and he raised a hand in greeting. “Razy!” he called out, pushing off the lamppost and walking toward her. “Morning, Leant,” she replied, her voice light but tinged with warmth. As he reached her, he tilted his head, studying her with an almost teasing look. “Let me guess. Late-night study session again?” Razy chuckled, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. “Something like that. And you? Up early for another run?” “Of course,” Leant said, flashing a grin. “Gotta keep sharp if I'm going to beat my old man someday.” Her smile faltered slightly at the mention of his father, but she quickly recovered. “I'm sure you will. You're already pretty good at what you do.” “Pretty good?” he echoed, feigning offense. “Razy, you wound me.” She laughed, the sound light and unrestrained. It was moments like these that made the weight of her secrets bearable. Around Leant, she could pretend—just for a little while—that she was like everyone else. The first bell rang, signaling the start of the school day. As they walked toward the entrance together, Leant glanced at her, his expression softening. “You know, you seem a little off today,” he said, his tone quieter. “Everything okay?” Razy hesitated, the question hitting closer to home than she wanted to admit. “I'm fine,” she said quickly, forcing a reassuring smile. “Just the usual stuff.” He didn't look entirely convinced but nodded. “Well, if you ever want to talk about the usual stuff, you know where to find me.” She nodded, grateful for his concern but acutely aware of the divide between them.
                <br><br>As the two entered the school, the chatter of students grew louder, blending with the clatter of lockers and the rhythmic ringing of shoes on tiled floors. The hallways of Raventide High buzzed with life, a stark contrast to the hushed elegance of Razy's home. She adjusted her bag, forcing herself to relax. Here, she could blend in, even if only for a few hours.“Razy! Leant!” A cheerful voice called out, cutting through the noise. Turning, they saw Kara Halley, a petite girl with shoulder-length auburn hair tied back in a loose ponytail. Her emerald-green eyes sparkled with mischief, and her expression carried a perpetual energy that Razy often envied. Kara waved enthusiastically as she jogged over, her pleated skirt swishing with each step. “There you are! I was beginning to think you two got detention or something.” Leant chuckled. “Detention? Us? Come on, Kara. We're model students.” Kara raised an eyebrow, smirking. “Sure. Tell that to Mr. Buchmann after last week's incident in chemistry.” “That was not my fault,” Leant said, feigning indignation. “Who knew Bunsen burners were so fragile?” “Everyone, Leant,” Razy said, suppressing a giggle. “Literally everyone.” “Traitors,” he muttered, though the grin tugging at his lips betrayed his amusement. Kara turned to Razy, her tone conspiratorial. “Hey, by the way, did you hear about the new transfer student? Apparently, he's in our homeroom.” “No,” Razy replied, tilting her head in curiosity. “Who is he?” Kara shrugged dramatically. “Some guy named Darius Ormond. Tall, broody, and apparently super smart. You know, the type teachers adore and students gossip about.” Leant groaned, leaning back against a locker. “Great. Another genius to make the rest of us look bad.” “Oh, don't worry, Leant,” Kara teased. “You're already in a league of your own. Just... maybe not the one you're thinking of.” Before Leant could respond, the warning bell rang, cutting their conversation short. “Better get moving,” Razy said, shouldering her bag. “See you two in class!” Kara called over her shoulder as she darted toward her locker.
                <br><br>Homeroom was a standard mix of chatter and the scraping of chairs as students filed in and settled into their seats. Razy took her usual spot by the window, her golden eyes briefly scanning the classroom. Leant sat beside her, pulling out his notebook and idly doodling in the margins while waiting for class to start. Moments later, the door opened, and the teacher, Mrs. Langston, walked in with a brisk efficiency that immediately commanded the room's attention. Behind her was a tall boy with dark hair and piercing gray eyes that seemed to scrutinize everything at once. “Class, we have a new student joining us today,” Mrs. Langston announced, gesturing for him to step forward. “This is Darius Ormond. I expect you'll all make him feel welcome.” Darius gave a curt nod, his expression unreadable as he scanned the room. He carried himself with a confidence that bordered on arrogance, but there was something else—an intensity that made Razy feel as though he could see straight through her.“You can take the empty seat over there,” Mrs. Langston said, pointing to the desk diagonally across from Razy. As Darius walked to his seat, whispers rippled through the classroom. “Is it just me, or does he seem kind of... intimidating?” Kara whispered to Razy, having slipped into the seat behind her. “Well, I don't know” Razy replied quietly, not impressed since she knew far worse from home. Leant, however, seemed unfazed. “What's with all the whispering?” he asked, leaning back in his chair. “He's just another guy. Nothing special.” Darius's sharp gaze flicked toward Leant, as if he'd heard the comment despite the low tone. For a brief moment, their eyes met, and an unspoken tension passed between them. The rest of the school day passed in a blur of lectures, assignments, and group work. During lunch, Razy and her small group gathered at their usual table outside in the courtyard. Kara was animated as usual, gesturing wildly as she recounted a story about her weekend mishap involving her cat and a carton of orange juice. Leant chuckled while nibbling on a sandwich, his relaxed demeanor a welcome contrast to the slight tension Razy still felt from the morning. “Hey, Darius!” Kara suddenly called out, waving enthusiastically. Razy turned her head to see Darius standing near the edge of the courtyard, his tray in hand. He hesitated, glancing around as if debating whether to join them. “Come sit with us!” Kara said, her tone inviting. To Razy's surprise, Darius complied, walking over with the same quiet confidence he'd displayed earlier. He sat down beside Kara, his movements deliberate and calculated. “Thanks,” he said simply, his voice smooth but distant. “No problem,” Kara replied cheerfully. “So, Darius, where'd you transfer from?” “Private academy up north,” he said, his tone clipped. “Fancy,” Leant said, raising an eyebrow. “Why'd you leave?” “Personal reasons,” Darius replied, his gray eyes locking onto Leant's for a moment before shifting away. The group fell into an awkward silence, broken only by Kara's attempts to lighten the mood with small talk. Razy observed Darius carefully, noting how he seemed to take in everything without giving much away. Despite his reserved demeanor, there was something about him that set her on edge—a feeling she couldn't quite shake. As lunch wound down and the group began to disperse, Darius stood and looked directly at Razy. “You seem... different,” he said, his tone low enough that only she could hear. Razy blinked, startled. “What do you mean?” He didn't answer, simply offering a small, enigmatic smile before walking away. As she watched him go, a faint chill ran down her spine. There was something about Darius Ormond that felt out of place, as though he didn't quite belong there.

            <h2>Chapter 2 : A different mission</h2>
            <p class="text">
                The brothel was buzzing tonight. Patrons from all corners of the city—politicians, high-profile criminals, and wealthy business moguls—mingled in the dim, lush hallways of Asmodeus's flagship establishment. In the heart of the establishment, the mood was intoxicatingly dark, tinged with luxury and secrecy. Velvet drapes hung from the walls, gold trim catching faint glimmers of light. The plush carpets silenced footsteps, while soft music underscored conversations spoken in hushed tones. In the shadows of this gilded environment, Mammon strode down the hallway, cutting an intimidating figure. His black and white pinstriped suit hugged his tall frame, his gloves glinting with eerie, sharpened blue fingertips. His jet-black hair framed his cold, sharp face, and his piercing blue eyes cut through the dark, surveying everything and everyone with a scrutinizing gaze. A faint, vertical red line ran beneath each eye, further adding to his unsettling, predatory appearance. But it was his left eye that drew the most attention—a bizarre red-ringed pattern around the pupil, a mark that even the other commanders found hard to look at directly. As he walked deeper into the brothel, patrons instinctively stepped aside, not daring to meet his gaze. Mammon's reputation was well known. He was not the kind to let small slights or disrespect go unanswered. Finally, he reached the end of the corridor and stopped in front of a heavy wooden door. Without knocking, he pushed it open and entered Asmodeus's private chamber. The room was decorated as lavishly as the rest of the brothel, but with an even grander flair. Heavy red velvet drapes hung from the walls, accented with gold trim and intricate designs. A large, ornately carved chair—thronelike in its design—stood at the center of the room. In it lounged Asmodeus, who looked utterly relaxed despite Mammon's sudden entrance. Asmodeus was an imposing figure, the tallest of the commanders, towering at 230 cm. His long black-and-white hair cascaded over his shoulders and down his back, standing in sharp contrast to his fair, almost ghostly complexion. He wore an extravagant velvet robe trimmed with white fur, its deep crimson hue making him appear almost regal. A flamboyant red hat, adorned with delicate swan feathers, sat atop his head, adding a theatrical touch to his already grandiose appearance.
                <br><br>“Mammon,” Asmodeus drawled, a lazy smile spreading across his face. He swirled a glass of red wine in his hand, not rising from his throne. “What brings you here tonight? Surely you're not here for pleasure?” Mammon narrowed his eyes, tossing a thick file onto the table between them. The stack landed with a satisfying thud, and Asmodeus raised an eyebrow, intrigued. “Business, I'm afraid,” Mammon said, his voice clipped and cold. “One of your...associates has been leaking information. Someone in this establishment has been feeding the police intel.” Asmodeus's lazy smile didn't falter, but there was a flicker of something sharp in his eyes as he set his glass down. “Ah, yes. Traitors—they're as common as dust these days. And as easily swept away.” “Maybe so,” Mammon replied, a hint of irritation in his voice. “But we need to sweep this one up quickly. If the wrong people hear about our operations, this brothel could be compromised. Lucifer won't be pleased if that happens.” Asmodeus leaned back in his chair, his fingers tracing the rim of his wine glass. “And you came all the way here to remind me of that, did you?” he asked, voice low and teasing. “I'm well aware of my duties, Mammon. You needn't worry yourself.” Mammon's expression didn't soften. “I don't trust your sense of urgency. Lucifer has given you an order, and I'm here to ensure it's followed.” The tension in the room thickened as Asmodeus met Mammon's gaze. Despite Mammon's reputation as one of the more ruthless commanders, Asmodeus wasn't intimidated. In fact, a hint of amusement sparked in his eyes as he watched Mammon's reaction. “Calm yourself,” Asmodeus said with a small smirk. “I'll handle it in due time. But while you're here, why don't you have a drink? You look like you could use one.” “I didn't come here to drink.” Mammon's voice was icy. “I came here to get results. If you don't take this seriously, I'll handle it myself.” Asmodeus tilted his head, his smile widening as if he were enjoying a private joke. “Now, now. No need to be hasty. I'm as loyal to Hell's Circle as anyone.” He took a slow sip of his wine, then added, “Besides, this establishment is my domain. I would know if something was amiss.” “Clearly, you don't,” Mammon retorted, his patience wearing thin. “The traitor was last seen here. Whether you know it or not, this leak is your responsibility.” Asmodeus set his wine glass down, his smile fading as he regarded Mammon with a cool, assessing gaze. “You may be right, my dear Mammon. But don't think for a second that I need your help to run my own business.” There was a pause as the two commanders stared each other down, each unwilling to yield. Mammon's fists clenched, his sharp glove tips glinting as he fought to keep his anger in check. Despite Asmodeus's nonchalant attitude, he was one of the few commanders Mammon couldn't simply intimidate into submission. Finally, Asmodeus broke the silence, his smile returning as he rose from his chair. “Very well. Since you're so concerned, I'll take immediate action. But remember, Mammon—our goals might be aligned, but our methods are very different.” Mammon grunted, turning to leave. “Just do what you have to. The last thing we need is another mistake on your end.” As he left the room, Mammon's mind churned with thoughts of the traitor. He wasn't satisfied with Asmodeus's response, but for now, it would have to do. The problem would be handled, one way or another. Asmodeus watched him go, a sly smile playing at his lips. He picked up the file Mammon had left behind, flipping through its pages with a calm, detached interest. If there truly was a traitor in his brothel, he'd find them. And they would pay dearly for their betrayal. But for now, he had other matters to attend to—other pleasures to indulge in, and other secrets to keep.
                <br><br>The night sky hung heavy and still as Leant made his way back to the small apartment he shared with his father. The hallway lights flickered, casting eerie shadows that seemed to reach out as he passed by. He pushed open the door to their apartment quietly, stepping into the darkened space and slipping off his shoes. Inside, the faint scent of beer and old leather drifted through the air. In the dim glow from the streetlight streaming in through the blinds, he spotted his father on the worn sofa, his chest rising and falling slowly with the heavy breathing of deep sleep. Empty beer bottles littered the floor around him, evidence of yet another night spent trying to numb old pain. Leant felt a pang in his chest as he observed the scene—a man worn down, haunted, and hollowed out by loss. Captain Aldric Turner, the man who once commanded respect and radiated strength as a high-ranking police captain, had become a shadow of himself ever since the death of Leant's mother. The tragedy had carved something out of him, and it was clear in the weary lines on his face, the unkempt stubble on his jaw, and the bottles that had taken up permanent residence in their home. Leant watched his father for a long moment, his expression unreadable. He took a step toward him, almost reaching out, but he stopped himself. There was nothing he could say or do to take away the grief that had settled so deeply in his father's heart. Instead, Leant silently moved past, careful not to disturb the stillness of the room. He walked down the narrow hallway to his own small bedroom. Once inside, he closed the door, flicked on a lamp, and took a deep breath. His room was sparsely decorated—just a bed, a small dresser, and a desk cluttered with books, papers, and the occasional stray tool. Leant moved to the closet, sliding open the door and reaching to the back, where he kept something he'd been piecing together for months now, a suit he could use for his own covert missions. With careful hands, he lifted it out and held it up to the dim light. The suit was sleek and dark, designed for stealth, with reinforced fabric that provided some protection without being overly bulky. It allowed him to move quickly and quietly, blending into shadows when he needed to. It wasn't a perfect disguise, but it was enough to conceal his identity and make him harder to recognize. He slipped into the suit, feeling its snug fit as he secured each part, adjusting the mask that would obscure his face. In the dim reflection of the mirror, he could barely recognize himself—a figure dressed in black, determined, purpose-driven, and prepared. As he secured the last part of his disguise, he reached for his phone and typed a quick message: ”Meet at Point Zero. 10 minutes.” The message went out to his trusted friends, his team—fellow students who shared his drive to fight back against Hell's Circle. They each had their own reasons for joining him on this risky mission, though none knew the full extent of Leant's connection to the terrorist group. In a way, they all felt the weight of injustice in the city, and each one wanted to strike back in whatever way they could. Leant took a deep breath, his eyes flicking back to the door. He glanced down the hallway toward the living room where his father lay, oblivious to his son's secret life. For a moment, guilt gnawed at him. His father had sacrificed everything for this job, this fight against Hell's Circle. Yet here he was, about to step out into the night to face the very organization that had destroyed their family—without his father knowing. He exhaled sharply, steeling himself. This was his choice, his mission. And if he was going to make a difference in this city, he had to act now. Quietly, Leant slipped out of his room, out of the apartment, and into the night. The city sprawled before him, a maze of neon lights and darkened alleys. He could feel the weight of his mission, the purpose driving him forward. Tonight, he and his team would take their first steps toward exposing Hell's Circle's secrets.
                <br><br>In the shadows of the city streets, Leant made his way to Point Zero. It was a quiet, abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of the city—a place few would dare enter, even in daylight. Its broken windows, cracked walls, and rusty doors made it a perfect meeting spot for anyone who didn't want to be seen. As he approached, he spotted his team gathering in the shadows outside, each one dressed in dark clothing, their faces hidden behind masks or scarves. A sense of pride surged in him as he looked at them; they were willing to risk everything to fight back against the powerful forces of Hell's Circle. The team consisted of four individuals besides Leant himself. There was Mira, a sharp-minded tech enthusiast who could crack most basic security systems; Finn, the brawler of the group, with a build almost as tall and muscular as Leant's own; Kai, a resourceful and daring strategist with a knack for spotting weaknesses in enemy defenses; and Eva, a talented artist and quick thinker who handled their communications and information gathering. Each of them had their own reasons for joining Leant, though none of them had revealed too much about their motivations. The unspoken bond they shared was based on a mutual understanding that Hell's Circle had somehow impacted each of their lives. “Everyone ready?” Leant asked as he approached, his voice low but steady. Mira nodded, holding up a small device. “Brought the portable scanner, as requested. Should pick up any unauthorized signals.” “Good,” Leant replied. He turned to Kai. “Any word on the latest intel?” Kai adjusted his dark hoodie, his sharp eyes flicking toward Leant. “I scouted one of the back alleys near the suspected safe house. It's definitely in use, but they've doubled the guards since last week. Looks like they're expecting someone to snoop around.” “Good to know,” Leant said. “Did you notice any blind spots we could use?” “There's a vent system at the southeast corner,” Kai replied. “It's narrow, but with Mira's gadgets, we might be able to get eyes inside without tripping their sensors.” Leant considered this for a moment, then addressed the group. “All right. Tonight, we're doing reconnaissance. In and out—no risks. If we see anything that could help us, we document it and leave. No confrontations.” There were nods of agreement, though Leant could see the eager light in Finn's eyes. He knew the guy wanted to do more than just observe, but tonight wasn't the night for bold moves. They were here to gather information, to find a weakness they could exploit later. “Let's move,” he said, gesturing toward the warehouse entrance. One by one, they slipped into the shadows, their footsteps silent as they began their mission.

            <h2>Chapter 3 : A moth's attraction</h2>
            <p class="text">
                The night was heavy with silence, broken only by the occasional rustle of wind through the abandoned lot behind the sprawling warehouse. Leant and his team crouched in the shadows, every breath calculated to avoid detection. The distant hum of machinery and muffled voices from within the warehouse served as an ominous reminder of the stakes. They had to move quickly; a single slip-up would mean disaster. Leant, dressed in his dark, fitted suit with a scarf covering his mouth, signaled his team to proceed. In the dim light, his brown eyes flashed with determination, and his muscular build allowed him to move with surprising agility. The suit, an assemblage of tactical gear and urban camouflage, was his own creation—a necessity for a high schooler daring to play vigilante in a city controlled by Hell's Circle. “This is it,” he whispered to the others, barely loud enough for them to hear. “We're going in, but quietly. We need those files, and we need to be gone before anyone notices.” Two of his teammates, Mira and Kai, nodded in sync. Mira, slight and wiry with an undeniable knack for technology, was already hacking into the warehouse's primitive security system on her tablet, her fingers flying across the screen. Kai, a tall, stocky f igure with a focused expression, tightened his grip on the baton he'd brought along for protection. “Security's a joke here,” Eva whispered with a grin. “I've looped the cameras around this area for f ive minutes. That's our window.” Leant gave her a small nod. “Nice work. Let's get in, grab the intel, and get out.” With the ease of a seasoned infiltrator, he slipped through a side door that Mira had unlocked. Inside, the warehouse was dimly lit, stacked with crates marked only by serial numbers—likely smuggling goods or weapon shipments for Hell's Circle. The faint scent of oil and rust filled the air, and their footsteps echoed faintly as they moved deeper into the maze of crates and storage shelves. Leant's pulse quickened as he led the way, every nerve in his body attuned to the slightest sound. The knowledge that Hell's Circle's men were likely around every corner kept him on edge, but he pushed down the fear, focusing only on the mission. They had practiced, planned, and now was their chance to make a real dent in Hell's Circle's operations.
                <br><br>They reached a door labeled “OFFICE—RESTRICTED.” Leant held up his hand, signaling them to wait as he leaned closer to listen. Silence. He gestured to Mira, who deftly picked the lock with a quick twist of her fingers. Inside, the office was small and cluttered, papers scattered over a desk and a single computer blinking on standby mode. Eva moved immediately to the computer, plugging in a USB drive. While she worked, Finn kept watch by the door, his posture tense and alert. “Almost... got it...” Eva muttered, her voice barely a whisper. Leant kept his eyes trained on the office doorway, his heart pounding as the seconds dragged on. Finally, she gave a triumphant nod. “Got it. All the shipment logs for next month. If Hell's Circle's planning anything big, we'll know about it.” Leant allowed himself a brief, relieved smile. “Great. Now let's get out of here.” Just as they turned to leave, a loud clatter echoed from the far side of the warehouse. They froze, exchanging alarmed glances. “Footsteps,” Kai whispered, clutching his baton tightly. “We need to move, now.” But it was too late. A figure appeared in the doorway, silhouetted by the dim lights outside. It was a tall, burly man with a shaved head, his outline hard and imposing. He wore a worn leather jacket, and a holstered gun glinted at his side—a typical Hell's Circle goon, but his presence alone meant trouble. “Hey!” the man barked, reaching for his weapon. “What do you think you're doing here?” Leant reacted immediately, grabbing a small smoke bomb from his belt. With a flick of his wrist, he threw it to the floor, and a thick cloud of gray smoke filled the room. “Go, go, go!” he hissed to the others as they bolted past the man, ducking under his outstretched arm. The smoke provided enough cover to allow them to slip back into the main warehouse area, weaving between crates and metal shelves as they made their way toward the exit. Leant's heart raced, his mind calculating their escape route as footsteps pounded behind them, the goon in hot pursuit. As they neared the side door, the sound of a gunshot split the air. A bullet whizzed past them, ricocheting off a metal crate with a sharp ping. Eva let out a small yelp but kept running, her face pale with fear. “Come on!” Leant urged, grabbing her hand and pulling her forward. Kai took the rear, shielding them from any further attacks. The team burst out of the warehouse and into the open night, the cold air biting against their skin. They sprinted across the abandoned lot, only slowing down when they were several blocks away. They ducked into an alleyway, catching their breath in the shadows. Leant quickly checked on his team. “Everyone okay?” Finn nodded, still a bit shaken. “Yeah. That was... too close.” Kai scowled, clutching his baton. “That guy wasn't messing around. We'd better lie low for a while.” Leant nodded. “Agreed. Let's head back for now. We'll regroup tomorrow and go over what we found.” He placed a reassuring hand on Mira's shoulder. “Good work, all of you. We pulled it off.” They shared a relieved smile, the thrill of success mingling with the tension of their close escape. For now, they'd managed to evade Hell's Circle's clutches.
                <br><br>The morning after the intrusion, Asmodeus stood still in the center of his room, the shadows seemed to dance around him as he surveyed the scene with a practiced calm. His red eyes gleamed faintly in the dim light, his mind already calculating the next steps. The goon's failure was frustrating, but not entirely unexpected. After all, attacks were more frequent with every passing day. The goon's shaky footsteps echoed through the hall as he finally made his way to Asmodeus's private space. Asmodeus didn't look up at first, his fingers absentmindedly tapping against the edge of his golden cane. The brothel was still and quiet at this early hour, save for the muffled sounds of distant conversations and the rustling of fabric as the last of the night's clientele left. The goon entered the room with a forced composure. His posture was rigid, and sweat clung to his brow. He knew that his report would not be met with kindness, especially after the botched operation the night before. “I-I'm sorry, sir,” the goon began, his voice quivering slightly. “We had them cornered, but... they managed to slip through our fingers.” Asmodeus's head snapped up at the sound of the goon's voice. His sharp red eyes narrowed in irritation, though he kept his expression carefully controlled. “‘Slipped through your fingers,'” Asmodeus repeated softly, the words dripping with disdain. “You had them cornered... and yet they got away.” The goon swallowed hard. “Y-Yes, sir. They used smoke bombs. We were blinded for a moment, and before we could regroup—” “Before you could regroup,” Asmodeus interrupted, his voice dark with irritation, “they were gone. How careless of you.” The goon winced, knowing the severity of his failure. He shifted nervously, but Asmodeus made no move. His piercing eyes seemed to look right through him, as though weighing the goon's very soul. “Who were they? Who was behind the operation?” “I—I don't know, sir,” the goon stammered, trying to backpedal. “It was just a team, like any other. Young... fast... I didn't get a clear look at their faces. But they were quick. They had some kind of smoke bombs... and weapons. I don't—” Asmodeus didn't let him finish.
                <br><br>In the span of a heartbeat, the goon felt a sharp coldness wrap around his throat. His vision blurred as he looked down to see Asmodeus's pistol in the man's gloved hand. With a faint smirk, Asmodeus squeezed the trigger. The report of the gun was brief but loud in the otherwise quiet room. The bullet struck the goon's forehead, sending him stumbling backward before his body crumpled to the floor with a soft thud. The goon never had a chance to react. Asmodeus stood over him for a moment, his long, graceful fingers still wrapped around the gold-plated pistol. The silencer had muffled the shot, but the finality of the action was clear. A single, swift movement—and the problem was dealt with. His lips curled into a small smile as he watched the lifeless body of the goon sprawled out on the floor. There was no need for theatrics with this one. Asmodeus had always preferred a clean, efficient solution. He calmly holstered the pistol, returning his attention to the mirror on the wall. His reflection stared back at him—a tall figure in a long, dark velvet robe with white fur trim, a tall red hat adorned with swan feathers, and the unmistakable sense of calm power that came with his every move. “Another failure,” Asmodeus muttered under his breath. “I'll need to deal with this... inconvenience.” The goon's death didn't faze him. To Asmodeus, it was just a minor setback, an unfortunate but necessary action in the game of power. The real problem was the group that had managed to evade. his men. Whoever they were, they clearly posed a risk to Hell's Circle. But they weren't his concern just yet. Asmodeus was content to let them make their moves. They were young, rash, and brash. They would eventually make a mistake. They always did. Still, it was annoying. The goon had failed, and now he would need to report to the higher-ups. But for now, he would deal with the mess later. “Prepare the next assignment,” Asmodeus ordered one of the nearby subordinates, who had been silently watching the entire interaction from the doorway. “Tighten the security on the shipments. No more surprises.” The subordinate nodded quickly, understanding the gravity of the situation. He stepped forward to clean up the mess, not daring to speak a word further as he made preparations for the next task. Asmodeus adjusted his hat, flicking a strand of swan feather that had come loose. He gazed into the mirror again, his expression turning thoughtful. “They think they can play at this game...,” he mused. “They're about to learn that they're not even close.” With that final thought, Asmodeus turned on his heel and exited the room, leaving the goon's lifeless body behind.
                <br><br>At the other side of the city, the morning bell rang, signaling the start of another school day. Students filtered into their classrooms, chatting and laughing as they went. Razy and Leant walked side by side down the hall, their footsteps echoing against the lockers. Razy's bright golden eyes f licked toward Leant, noticing the faint bags under his eyes and the tired slump of his posture. “You look tired,” Razy said with a teasing smile, nudging him lightly with her shoulder. “You sure you didn't stay up too late playing games?” Leant, looking slightly exhausted, offered a tired smile but didn't respond right away. “Yeah, just didn't get enough sleep,” he muttered, running a hand through his disheveled brown hair. He seemed to be somewhere between laughing off the comment and actually responding to it. Razy raised an eyebrow, her gaze shifting playfully from him to the hallway as they continued walking. “Late night of what ? Fighting off monsters in your sleep?” Before Leant could answer, a voice interrupted the exchange from behind them. “You know, if you're really that tired, maybe you should get some sleep like me,” came a sarcastic voice from one of their classmates, Isaac. Isaac was the self-proclaimed king of late-night gaming, with messy brown hair and glasses perched low on his nose. He was also a habitual all-nighter, spending his time in front of a computer screen playing multiplayer games long after most of them had gone to bed. Leant turned slightly, half-smiling at Isaac. “No offense, but I'm not trying to become a walking zombie like you.” Isaac grinned widely, his eyes twinkling with mischief. “Oh please, I'm a lost cause. I've perfected the art of sleep deprivation. You just need to embrace the grind, Leant!” Tasha, another of their classmates, rolled her eyes but couldn't help laughing. “You're a walking meme, Isaac. You make the rest of us look like we're slacking off in comparison.” “Yeah, seriously, even last week you gambled half your money online for robux, and you lost.” James chimed in, a stocky boy with a grin that was almost always plastered on his face. Isaac shrugged dramatically. “It's not my fault the games are so addictive! Sleep is overrated anyway,” he said with a grin, but the faint bags under his eyes told a different story. “You guys should try it sometime. It builds character.” Leant raised his hands in mock surrender. “I'm good, thanks. I'll stick with my usual eight hours, if that's alright.” Razy glanced at Leant, raising an eyebrow as she teased him again. “Sounds like you could learn a thing or two from Isaac. Just think of how much more you could get done if you never slept!” she said with a playful smile, her tone light, but there was an underlying concern behind it that she quickly masked with humor. Leant gave her a tired, half-hearted smile, but his voice was soft as he spoke. “Maybe next time I'll try it. But I think I'd just end up dead on the floor.” “Yeah, because you're already halfway there,” Tasha joked, leaning back against the wall with a smirk. “Exactly,” Isaac chimed in with a smirk of his own. “And trust me, once you get used to the exhaustion, it's no big deal.” James shook his head and nudged Leant in the shoulder. “You're a better man than me if you're not signing up for that. I value my sleep a little too much to mess with my brain that way.” Razy smiled at Leant again, her golden eyes twinkling with amusement, but there was still a hint of concern underneath the humor. “I still think you need a break, Leant. Don't push yourself too hard.” Leant sighed, but he appreciated her concern. “I'll be fine, don't worry about me.”
                <br><br>Their conversation was interrupted as the classroom door opened, and Mr. Sanders walked in with his usual stern look, though a small smile tugged at the corner of his lips. “Alright, you lot. We've got work to do. Time to get settled, or I'll start giving out detentions.” The banter stopped as everyone hurried into the classroom, their playful teasing temporarily forgotten. Razy took her usual seat by the window, casting one last glance at Leant, who seemed more exhausted than ever. She could still see the tiredness in his posture, the way he dragged his feet into the room, and the heavy look in his eyes that didn't match the usual determination she saw in him. As they sat down, the sounds of their classmates chattering filled the room, but Razy's mind was elsewhere, focused on Leant. She tried to shake off the feeling of worry, but it lingered. Something was definitely off, and she wasn't sure what was causing it.

            <h2>Chapter4 : The queen's court</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Razy stretched lazily as she stepped out of her room, her eyes still heavy with the lingering remnants of sleep. The house was quiet, an unsettling stillness that hung in the air like the calm before a storm. It was still early in the afternoon, and the mansion was mostly empty—except for a few staff and a couple of the family's closest subordinates. Razy hadn't seen her mother, Lilith, all morning. The house had always felt vast, and as she walked deeper into the halls, she began to feel the familiar sense of isolation creeping in. Despite the grandeur of their estate, it often felt cold, empty. Her mother had always been elusive, even at home. Lilith, the queen of Hell's Circle, had a way of vanishing behind the walls, tucked away in her own world. Razy turned a corner and saw one of the servants cleaning the floor. "Excuse me," she called softly. "Have you seen my mother?" The servant paused, bowing low to Razy with a deferential nod. "Lady Lilith is in the theater, Miss Razy." Razy smiled and nodded, continuing down the hall towards the private theater, her long golden hair swaying gently behind her. The theater, like everything in their home, was a place of quiet luxury, designed for both performance and solitude. Razy reached the double doors of the private theater, where soft light filtered out into the hallway. Her hand hesitated just before pushing the door open. Her heart swelled with affection. Lilith had always had an uncanny way of making the world feel small and intimate, even in the midst of all the chaos that surrounded them. There was a sense of strength in her, like a queen perched on a throne, yet always patient with Razy's childish whims. She opened the door. Inside, the theater was bathed in warm light, casting shadows on the red velvet seats that lined the walls. A large stage stood at the center, currently unoccupied, but the curtains were drawn. Lilith sat in the front row, dressed in a long dark purple gown that trailed behind her as she leaned back against the plush cushions. Her golden eyes seemed to glow softly, almost as if they were aglow with an inner fire. The pearls of her collar shimmered under the soft light. She looked regal, as always, but there was something serene about her posture today. Perhaps it was the absence of the usual weight of her responsibilities, or maybe it was simply the calm she found in her private space. Razy smiled, stepping forward. "Hey, Mom. You've been hiding in here all day?" Lilith turned her head slowly, her lips curving into a warm smile as she saw her daughter. "Ah, Razy." Razy leaned against the back of the chair, her arms crossed as she regarded her mother curiously. "You're always in here when you want to avoid people. What's up?" Lilith laughed softly, a musical sound that filled the room. "Sometimes, a little solitude is needed. But today, I thought you might like to join me." She gestured to the space in front of her. "I know you've been practicing your dance. Why don't you show me?" Razy blinked in surprise. She hadn't expected her mother to take an interest in her training today. But something in Lilith's voice—gentle, coaxing, but with an undeniable authority—made Razy smile. "Alright, alright. I guess I can show you a bit." Razy stepped onto the stage, the floor cool beneath her feet as she positioned herself in the center. Lilith watched intently, her golden eyes never leaving Razy's movements. As Razy began to dance, her motions fluid and graceful, she felt her nerves settle. She was used to performing for Lilith, but today felt different. There was an air of quiet expectation from her mother that made Razy want to give it her all.
                <br><br>As Razy continued to dance, she remained blissfully unaware of the shadow that lingered just outside the theater's grand entrance. A spy, one of the countless faceless agents of the police, had slipped into the house, intent on taking Razy out while she was alone. The man crouched low in the darkened hallway, his eyes narrowed with focus. He had been instructed to eliminate the girl before she could pose a threat to the greater mission of infiltrating Hell's Circle. His gun was drawn, ready to strike. But before he could make his move, the air seemed to change. The shadows in the corners of the room thickened, as if alive, and from those depths emerged figures—swift, silent, and deadly. One of Lilith's subordinates stepped forward from the shadows, his movements like that of a predator. Without a word, he intercepted the assassin, his hand swiftly catching the man's wrist and twisting it with brutal precision. The gun fell to the floor with a clatter, and the man was pulled into the darkness before he could even react. Razy, completely unaware of the danger that had been looming just moments ago, continued her dance, lost in the rhythm of her movements. The soft sound of her steps was the only noise that filled the space. In the shadows, the subordinate delivered a swift, lethal strike to the spy, and just like that, the threat was neutralized. Lilith, still seated calmly in the front row, didn't even flinch. She observed the scene with a detached calmness, the same air of authority she always carried. After a moment, she turned back to Razy, who was now finishing a particularly intricate spin. Lilith's eyes glimmered with something like pride. "You've become quite skilled," Lilith remarked, her voice soft and almost soothing. Razy, slightly out of breath, flashed her mother a grin. "Thanks, Mom. I'm getting there." As Razy departed the private theater, Lilith's warm gaze turned cold and calculating, her expression hardening the instant her daughter was out of sight. She cast a quick glance towards the shadows by the side of the stage, and a figure emerged with the smoothness of a wraith. Leviathan stepped forward, his tall, lean figure obscured by a dark trench coat and red inner shirt. Unlike the others, he wore no grand adornment, yet his quiet, menacing presence spoke volumes. His green eyes glinted with a knowing gleam, his gaze fixated on Lilith with the unwavering attention of a predator. “Leviathan,” Lilith intoned, her voice low and commanding. He bowed his head slightly. “Yes, Lady Lilith.” Lilith's lips pressed into a thin line. “One of the police's rats found their way inside, foolishly risking his life to get near Razy. Take this as your signal: comb through the entire police force if you must, but I want every operative, informant, and spy sniffed out. I will not tolerate another misstep near her.” Leviathan's eyes darkened, his fingers tightening around the heavy halberd strapped to his back. “Understood. They've been getting bold lately,” he muttered, a quiet anger simmering in his tone. “Do you think this was a mere test of our defenses?” Lilith narrowed her gaze, thoughtful. “Perhaps. The police captain may be desperate enough to start using brash tactics. But they've given us an opening, and I expect you to exploit it.” “Consider it done,” Leviathan replied, his voice laced with a steely determination. Lilith's gaze softened, but only slightly. “Handle it swiftly, and ensure Razy remains unaware. The last thing I need is for her to be targeted.” With a respectful nod, Leviathan turned and slipped back into the shadows, moving like a silent predator. He would fulfill her command with an efficiency that would leave no trace behind. Lilith watched him disappear, a small smile tugging at her lips. Her thoughts turned to her daughter's innocent smile, the way she danced so freely, unburdened by the dark truths surrounding her. Razy was the only light in her life, and Lilith would go to any lengths to keep her safe, even if it meant eliminating half the police force in the city.
                <br><br>As Razy stepped out of the private theater, her mood was lighter after the dancing lesson with her mother. She looked up at the clear evening sky, the sun beginning its descent and casting a golden hue over the city. A familiar voice calling her name startled her out of her thoughts. “Razy!” Turning towards the sound, she saw Leant standing a few steps away, his hands stuffed casually into his pockets. He looked as if he'd been waiting for her for a while, his hair slightly tousled, and a boyish grin on his face. “Leant?” she asked, blinking in surprise. “What are you doing here?” He shrugged, playing it off with a nonchalant air. “I was just passing by and thought I'd wait to say hi. You're not avoiding me, are you?” Razy laughed, her gold eyes sparkling. “As if I could. But seriously, this area isn't exactly on the way to anywhere you'd normally go. What's up?” Leant rubbed the back of his neck, his casual demeanor slipping just slightly as he avoided her gaze for a moment. “Well, I was wondering if you'd like to go to the cinema tonight. There's a new movie out I think you'd like.” Her eyebrows rose, and a teasing smile curled on her lips. “Is this your way of asking me out ?” His face reddened just a little, but he managed to keep his composure. “Maybe it is. Maybe it isn't. Guess you'll have to come and find out.” Razy giggled, appreciating his effort to act cool. “Alright, you win. What time?” “Let's meet around seven?” he offered, visibly relaxing now that she'd agreed. “Seven it is,” she confirmed, giving him a small wave as she started walking away. “But you better not pick a boring movie!” “Wouldn't dream of it!” Leant called after her, watching her retreat with a fond smile. As Razy turned a corner, out of sight, Leant let out a small sigh of relief, leaning back against a streetlamp. Asking her out, even casually, was more nerve-wracking than he'd anticipated. Still, he couldn't help but feel a flicker of excitement at the thought of spending the evening with her. As the evening approached, Razy found herself standing in front of her wardrobe, deliberating over what to wear. Her usual confidence seemed to falter as she scanned her options, unsure if this was just a casual outing with a friend or something more. “Why am I overthinking this?” she muttered to herself, finally settling on a simple yet elegant light-blue dress paired with a white cardigan. It wasn't too dressy but still felt a little special—just in case. By the time she arrived at the cinema, the streets were alive with the evening crowd. Neon lights flickered on the theater's marquee, casting colorful reflections on the pavement. She spotted Leant near the entrance, leaning against the wall with his hands tucked into his jacket pockets. When he noticed her, his eyes lit up, and he quickly straightened, giving her an approving once-over. “You look...nice,” he said, fumbling slightly. Razy grinned, twirling playfully. “Thanks. You don't look too bad yourself.” Leant was dressed in his usual casual style, but he'd swapped his school uniform for a simple button-up shirt and dark jeans. It wasn't anything fancy, but it suited him. “What movie are we watching?” she asked as they joined the line. “It's a mystery thriller,” Leant replied. “Figured you'd enjoy something with twists and turns.” “Good choice,” she said with a nod, though her teasing smirk remained. “Lucky for you. I would've made you sit through a cheesy romance otherwise.” Leant chuckled. “I'll keep that in mind next time.” As they made their way inside, the smell of popcorn filled the air, and the murmurs of excited moviegoers created a lively buzz. They grabbed their tickets, snacks, and found seats near the back of the theatre. When the movie ended, the two stepped back into the cool night air. The streets were quieter now, the bustle of the city slowing as the hour grew late. “That was better than I expected,” Razy said, stretching her arms. “Yeah, it wasn't bad,” Leant agreed, though his mind seemed elsewhere. She gave him a sidelong glance. “Still thinking about your ‘studying'?” Leant chuckled, scratching the back of his head. “Something like that.” They walked in comfortable silence for a while before Razy spoke again. “Thanks for inviting me tonight. It was fun.” “I'm glad you came,” Leant replied earnestly, meeting her gaze. For a brief moment, the world around them seemed to fade, leaving just the two of them under the glow of a streetlamp. Razy broke the moment with a playful nudge. “Walk me home?” Leant nodded, falling into step beside her as they headed toward her house.
                <br><br>Far from the quiet streets where Razy and Leant walked, the glow of a hundred screens bathed a dimly lit room in pale blue light. Mammon sat in his usual place, his fingers dancing across a sleek keyboard as he toggled between camera feeds from across the city. His piercing blue eyes darted between the screens, scanning for any irregularities, while his thin lips curled into a perpetual smirk. The room was a chaotic symphony of beeping monitors, the hum of electronics, and the clatter of his gloves against the keys. A new feed blinked to life in the center screen. It displayed an alley just outside the local cinema. Mammon's eyes skimmed over it—another routine scan—before something caught his attention. “Hmm?” he murmured, leaning closer. The feed showed Razy, his boss's daughter, strolling down the street with someone by her side. A boy, tall and brown-haired, with a casual demeanor that seemed at ease next to her. Mammon's fingers stilled, and his smirk faded. “Who's this?” He switched to another camera, following their movements as they continued to chat and laugh. His sharp mind immediately began cataloguing details. The boy's body language, his height, his attire—everything was stored away for later review. “Doesn't look like one of ours,” Mammon muttered, his voice laced with curiosity. A tinge of annoyance crept into his tone. “And she didn't mention anyone new…” With a swift keystroke, he saved the footage and began running a facial recognition scan on the boy. As the system worked, Mammon leaned back in his chair, his gloved fingers tapping rhythmically against the armrest. “Let's see who you are, mystery man,” he mused, his tone light but his eyes cold and calculating. “Leant, uh…”
